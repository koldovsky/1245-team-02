                <p>"I really liked the variety. The best part was a video recording of students learning French and speaking to each other. A close second favorite was listening to audio recordings and choosing a response to what you've heard. Very thought out. I will definitely recommend your lessons to friends."</p>

                <p>"I always wanted to learn Chineese but never had time for that. The offline course was a savior for me. I like that the course materials include text, audio, video, plus interactive exercises. Speaking with great teachers makes learning more fun. I recommend them and will continue my learning."</p>

                <p>"I have taken French lessons before both in a traditional class and via Skype. The online classroom at LinguaNow is on par with a regular classroom, but with the added benefit of having private lessons. Teachers are very friendly, and I know that teaching French can be just as irritating."</p>
